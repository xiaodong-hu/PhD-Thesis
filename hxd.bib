abstract={Systems simultaneously exhibiting superconductivity and spin{\^a}{\texteuro}``orbit coupling are predicted to provide a route toward topological superconductivity and unconventional electron pairing, driving significant contemporary interest in these materials. Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors in particular lack inversion symmetry, yielding an antisymmetric form of spin{\^a}{\texteuro}``orbit coupling that admits both spin-singlet and spin-triplet components of the superconducting wavefunction. Here, we present an experimental and theoretical study of two intrinsic TMD superconductors with large spin{\^a}{\texteuro}``orbit coupling in the atomic layer limit, metallic 2H-TaS2 and 2H-NbSe2. We investigate the superconducting properties as the material is reduced to monolayer thickness and show that high-field measurements point to the largest upper critical field thus reported for an intrinsic TMD superconductor. In few-layer samples, we find the enhancement of the upper critical field is sustained by the dominance of spin{\^a}{\texteuro}``orbit coupling over weak interlayer coupling, providing additional candidate systems for supporting unconventional superconducting states in two dimensions.},

journal={npj Quantum Materials},

abstract={We report on the emergence of robust superconducting order in single crystal alloys of TaSe2{\^a}ˆ'xSx(0{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttenthousand}{\^a}{\texttenthousand}¤{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttenthousand}{\~A}---{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttenthousand}{\^a}{\texttenthousand}¤{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttenthousand}2). The critical temperature of the alloy is surprisingly higher than that of the two end compounds TaSe2 and TaS2. The evolution of superconducting critical temperature Tc(x) correlates with the full width at half maximum of the Bragg peaks and with the linear term of the high-temperature resistivity. The conductivity of the crystals near the middle of the alloy series is higher or similar than that of either one of the end members 2H-TaSe2 and/or 2H-TaS2. It is known that in these materials superconductivity is in close competition with charge density wave order. We interpret our experimental findings in a picture where disorder tilts this balance in favor of superconductivity by destroying the charge density wave order.},
